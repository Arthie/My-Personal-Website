I’m Arthur, a developer living in Kortrijk, Belgium with 6 years of programming experience in design, development, and testing of web applications.

Tinkering from a young age helped me accumulate extensive knowledge of tech, electronics, and problem-solving in general. I am committed to searching and learning new technology to further develop my lifelong passion. Being a curious perfectionist makes sure I perform my best when creating rich experiences.

## Present

Right now, I’m searching for the job that will challenge and keep me satisfied for the years to come. I’m leaning towards a remote position as web application developer. I appreciate flexible working hours and being able to work from anywhere.

I have been working as a web developer for several years. Challenging myself and trying new things gives me the ability to realize more diverse assignments. As a creative developer, I benefit from having a problem-solving mindset in which user experience and performance come first. I am a social person with a great sense of responsibility. I like to work together in a team where I can learn from colleagues and them from me.

### Volunteering

Until this summer I was an active scouts member. For the past 5 years, I happily volunteered my time as a scout leader. Being a mentor and friend to the members was very rewarding.

## Future

The future is hard to predict, I’m not a detailed long term planner. I’d rather set goals I want to achieve and work towards those when the opportunity arrives. Ultimately I strive to live my life with the least regrets.

Some of these goals are:

- Starting a Blog and give back to the community and share some of my thoughts and experiences.
- Join a Bug bounty program and find my first valuable bug.
- Figure out how to increase my productivity without becoming obsessed.
- Create a project with Rust.

## Offline

Taking a break from behind the keyboard and exploring the world is something I need to do! I regularly go out camping with my friends. The memories of going on an adventure and sharing new experiences make me eagerly await our next trip. To clear my mind I like to go for a run, play golf, tennis or skiing during the winter.
